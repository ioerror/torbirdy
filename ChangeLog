  Fix a bug in 0.0.11 that prevented account preferences from being set

  TorBirdy no longer requires a configured HTTP proxy for full use with Tor
  TorBirdy now enforces the safest HTTP proxy usage possible with GnuPG
    TorBirdy attempts to disable all name resolution in GnuPG due to a serious
    SOCKS5 problem with GnuPG proxy options to how we invoke GnuPG; GnuPG only
    supports SOCKS5 when it is linked against libcurl (>7.21.7) and hostnames
    are not used. This is outlined the following bug:
